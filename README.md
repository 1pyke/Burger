# Burger Design

## Design Overview

This repository contains the code for designing a realistic burger using HTML and CSS. The burger consists of various components such as buns, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and a patty. The goal is to create a visually appealing burger that is also responsive.

### Burger Components

The burger design is created using HTML and CSS techniques. The following components are included:

- Buns
- Lettuce
- Tomatoes
- Cheese
- Patty

The design and colors of each component can be customized to achieve a realistic look. The burger is positioned at the center of the page to ensure a visually pleasing layout.

## Responsiveness

To make the burger responsive, the following techniques are implemented:

- Media Queries: Media queries are used to apply different styles to the burger components based on the viewport size. This ensures that the burger adapts and remains fully visible within smaller viewports.

- Flexbox: Flexbox is utilized for flexible layout and alignment of the burger components. It helps in maintaining the centered position of the burger within the viewport as it increases in size.

- Percentage-based Sizing: The sizes of the burger components are defined using percentages rather than fixed pixel values. This allows the burger to scale proportionally and maintain its visual balance on different devices.

- Fluid Width: The overall width of the burger container is set to a percentage value, allowing it to adjust and fill the available space within the viewport.

## Additional Notes

- The design and color choices for the burger components can be customized as per project requirements.
- The code is organized and structured to ensure readability and maintainability.
- Comments are provided within the CSS code to explain the purpose and functionality of specific sections.
